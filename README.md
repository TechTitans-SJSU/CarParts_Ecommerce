# E-commerce Application with Chatbot Integration

This repository contains an e-commerce application which sells car parts, with an integrated chatbot feature. The applicationâ€™s components are containerized using Docker and automatically built and deployed with CircleCI.

## Project Components

### Frontend Application
- Located in `/ecommerce-frontend`
- Built with Reactjs
- Includes automated testing suite

### Backend Service
- Located in `/ecommerce-backend`
- Built with Node.js
- OpenAPI spec based REST API - Swagger
- Includes automated testing suite

### Natural Language Processing API (Chatbot)
- Located in `/ecommerce-chatbot`
- Built with Python 3.9
- Integrates with OpenAI API
- Requires database configuration

### Redis Application
- Located in `/redis`
- Built with Python 3.9
- Handles caching and data persistence

### RabbitMq
- Located in `/messaging queue`
- Used for message queuing to enable reliable and asynchronous communication between components

### Observability & Metrics
- Locatied in `/observability`
- These tools provide real-time observability and analytics for the infrastructure and application

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses CircleCI for continuous integration and deployment. The pipeline consists of five main jobs:

1. `frontend-build`: Builds and tests the frontend application
2. `backend-build`: Builds and tests the backend service
3. `nlapi-build`: Builds the NL API service with required environment configuration
4. `redis-app-build`: Builds the Redis application with required environment configuration
5. `rabbitmq-build`: Builds the RabbitMq application with required environment configuration

Each job:
- Sets up the appropriate Docker environment
- Installs dependencies
- Runs tests (where applicable)
- Builds Docker images
- Pushes images to Docker Hub

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. For local development, create `.env` files in the respective directories with the required environment variables
3. Install dependencies for each component:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

### Start RabbitMQ server:
```
rabbitmq-server start
```
